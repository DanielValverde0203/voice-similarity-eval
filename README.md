# voice-similarity-eval

**A reproducible evaluation toolkit for voice similarity, speaker identity preservation, and perceptual quality in TTS and voice conversion systems.**

This repository provides a **modular, low-cost, and ethically grounded** framework to evaluate **how similar a synthetic voice is to a natural reference voice**, with a strong focus on **assistive speech technologies** and **Spanish (including Costa Rican variants)**.

It is designed for:

* academic research,
* student-driven projects,
* evaluation of TTS, voice cloning, and voice conversion systems,
* responsible development of personalized artificial voices.

---

## Project goals

1. Evaluate **speaker similarity** between reference and synthetic speech.
2. Compare **objective similarity metrics** with **human perceptual judgments**.
3. Study **robustness** under noise, compression, and channel effects.
4. Provide **ethical and reproducible evaluation protocols** for assistive voices.
5. Enable **large-scale student participation** through modular subprojects.

## What does this repository evaluate?

| Dimension                       | Description                                               |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Speaker identity similarity** | Does the synthetic voice sound like the same person?      |
| **Perceptual quality**          | Is the voice natural, pleasant, and intelligible?         |
| **Consistency**                 | Is similarity preserved across different utterances?      |
| **Robustness**                  | How does similarity degrade with noise or compression?    |
| **Age / style cues**            | Does the perceived age or speaking style remain coherent? |

## Implemented evaluation metrics (baseline)

### Objective metrics

* **Cosine similarity** between speaker embeddings
* **Speaker verification scores** (same / different speaker)
* **Mel Cepstral Distortion (MCD)**
* Statistical distances in pitch, energy, and duration

> ⚠️ Important: Objective metrics **do not replace human perception**.
> This toolkit is designed to **compare and study correlations**, not to replace listening tests.

---

### Human perceptual evaluation

#### MOS (Mean Opinion Score)

* Naturalness
* Speaker similarity
* Clarity / intelligibility

#### ABX tests

* **A**: reference voice
* **B**: synthetic voice 1
* **X**: synthetic voice 2

Question: *Which voice (B or X) sounds more similar to A?*

The repository includes:

* automatic pair generation,
* test forms,
* statistical analysis scripts.

---

## Recommended evaluation protocols

1. **Clean condition**

   * Reference vs. synthetic speech
2. **Noise robustness**

   * Controlled SNR levels
3. **Compression robustness**

   * WhatsApp / Opus / MP3
4. **Cross-utterance consistency**

   * Same speaker, different sentences
5. **Longitudinal consistency**

   * Same voice across multiple sessions

---

## Typical use cases

* Comparing multiple TTS systems for the same target voice
* Evaluating identity preservation in assistive speech systems
* Measuring degradation through real communication channels
* Course projects in audio, ML, and AI
* Perceptual studies with student listeners

---

## Student-friendly research projects

* Implement new similarity metrics
* Compare different speaker embedding models
* Analyze bias related to perceived age or gender
* Improve ABX experimental design
* Study correlation between objective metrics and MOS
* Extend the toolkit to Costa Rican Spanish

Each topic can be developed **independently**, making the repository ideal for large cohorts.

## Ethics and responsible use

This repository **is not intended for identity impersonation**.

Mandatory principles:

* Informed consent from all recorded speakers
* Research-only and assistive use cases
* No release of models trained on private voices
* Transparent reporting of errors and limitations

See:

* `ethics/consent_templates.md`
* `ethics/usage_policy.md`

## Quick installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ORG/voice-similarity-eval.git
cd voice-similarity-eval
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Minimal example

```python
from metrics.cosine_similarity import compute_similarity

score = compute_similarity(
    reference_wav="data/reference/ref_01.wav",
    synthetic_wav="data/synthesized/syn_01.wav"
)

print("Similarity score:", score)
```
